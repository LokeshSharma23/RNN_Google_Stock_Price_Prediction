# RNN_Google_Stock_Price_Prediction
Predicting Google Stock Price Treds using Recurrent Neural Network and Keras-Tensorflow Backend

Dataset: Google's stock price data from 2012 to 2016.

Model Building Steps:
1. Importing libraries
2. Importing the training dataset
3. Feature Scaling using MinMaxScaler
4. Creating datastructure with 100 timestamps
5. Building Recurrent Neural Network Model
6. Importing Keras Libraries using Tensorflow Backend
7. Initializing the RNN using Sequential class
8. Adding four LSTM(Low Short Term Memory layers) and perfoming regularisation using Dropout
9. Adding final output layer using Dense module
10. Compiling the RNN network.
11. Fitting the model to the training set
12. Making prediction on the test set
13. Visualization of Real vs Predicted Stock Trends using Matplotlib
