# RNN_Google_Stock_Price_Trend_Prediction

Objective : To predict the trends of Google Stock Price using Recurrent Neural Networks using 
            Keras-Tensorflow backend

Dataset: Dataset consists of 5 years Google's stock price data.

Model Building Steps:
1. Importing libraries
2. Importing the training dataset
3. Feature Scaling using MinMaxScaler
4. Creating datastructure with 100 timestamps
5. Building Recurrent Neural Network Model
6. Importing Keras Libraries using Tensorflow Backend
7. Initializing the RNN using Sequential class
8. Adding four LSTM(Long Short Term Memory layers) and perfoming regularisation using Dropout
9. Adding final output layer using Dense module
10. Compiling the RNN network.
11. Fitting the model to the training set
12. Making prediction on the test set
13. Visualization of Real vs Predicted Stock Trends using Matplotlib
